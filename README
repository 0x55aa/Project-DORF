Welcome to Project D.O.R.F. 

A game in the style of Dwarf Fortress written in Python.

Dwarf Fortress is a game with a fascinating concept. The game simulates quite a large number of different systems which all pose unique and interesting computer science challenges. 

The primary goal of this project is to provide a platform upon which interested parties can experiment with algorithms for those different systems, and to see if we can improve upon the performance of the original game.

The secondary goal is to perhaps someday actually have a game that somebody would want to play. Perhaps even to have an engine upon which many Dwarf Fortress style games could be easily developed by anyone.

Complete documentaiton is in the docs folder.
